# Giskord

Dead simple gtk discord client, made mostly for fun.

Usage:

## Compiling
Compiling requires gtk3 libs, its gonna be a pain if you're on windows.

## Running: 
`DG_TOKEN="your token here" giscord`

# Keys: 
ctrl-g refreshes the server list, e.g if you're on a bot account they will then be sorted alphabetically
